# Project Name

A chatbot for ordering a plant based on how good the user is at caring for them. Based on that a random plant is given by the Genie.

## The problem

The biggest issue was with the functions which were not invoked one at a time.
So I fix it by using properly sequencing the actions using 'setTimeout'. This approach ensured a smoother user experience by simultating a conversational flow. I left all the comments in the script for the purpose of learning as I strugle a lot with understanding the JS language
